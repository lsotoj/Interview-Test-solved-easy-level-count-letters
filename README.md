# Interview-Test-solved-easy-level-count-letters
Due to I was applying to some developer positions and I got stuck in the practice tests. I decided to solve one by one of the most difficult test and share with the community.  This is a problem where I have a function called "countLetters". So, given a string as a parameter, I should return what letter is the most repeated on the chain.
